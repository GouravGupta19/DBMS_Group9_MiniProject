Employee Payroll Management System Project
This project is a comprehensive employee payroll management system designed to handle employee details, salary structure, attendance, and payroll processing.

It leverages a MySQL database and utilizes advanced SQL features such as stored procedures, triggers, and cursors to automate payroll calculations and data consistency.

Dedicated tables for Employees, Payroll, and Attendance ensure robust data management and enforce referential integrity.

The system supports dynamic queries and real-time updates, simplifying payroll operations and reducing manual errors.

Developed by Group 4 as part of our B.Tech 2nd Year project, this system emphasizes scalability and ease of future enhancement.

This solution offers an efficient framework for modern payroll processing needs, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and administrative ease for any organization.
